# MapReduce
Assignment 1
Question 1: 
Consider the following data items where each item represents a record on a table; each record is 
have 3 values (Table name, PK, AttributeValue). The database schema of the tables can be described 
as follow:
T1(A1,A2)
T2(A3,A1)
The data items are as follow:
(T1, 1, x)
(T1, 2, x)
(T1, 3, x)
(T1, 4, y)
(T1, 5, y)
(T1, 6, y)
(T1, 7, z)
(T1, 8, z)
(T2, A, 1)
(T2, B, 2)
(T2, C, 3)
1- Write a map/reduce program to do an inner join between T1 and T2 where A1 in T1 is a 
foreign key in T2. 
The query results should be:
(A, 1,X)
(B, 2,X)
(C, 3,X)
2- Write a map/reduce program to do a full outer join between T1 and T2 where A1 in T1 is a 
foreign key in T2. 
The query results should be:
(A, 1,X)
(B, 2,X)
(C, 3,X)
(null, 4, y)
(null, 5, y)
(null, 6, y)
(null, 7, z)
(null, 8, z)
3- Write a map/reduce program to find out the difference between two attributes. For 
example : A1[T1] â€“ A1[T2] , The result would [4,5,6,7,8]
Question 2:
Consider the following data items where each item represents a friendship relationship between 
persons: 
(P1,P2)
(P1,P3)
(P3,P4)
(P2,P4)
(P2,P5)
Write a map/reduce program to find the friends of friends for a given person
For example: find the friends of P1 friends
P1 friends would be: P2, P3
Friends of P2 and P3 are (P4, P5)
